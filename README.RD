1.Why write another copy of repo?
Sometimes repo project is hard to set up for someone or small company.
But they can easily set up git server by Gitbucket or Bitbucket.
If they want to split their project into multi repositories, a tool like repo is required.

1)Add the repositories into the repo_manifest list by manual.
